This is my personal Git Cheat Sheet that I refer to when I forget (which I always do).

Initialising Git and pushing to a repository in GitHub

1. Initialize Git in your project folder
`git init`
2. Add all files to staging
`git add .`
3. Commit the files
`git commit -m "Initial commit"`
4. Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub repo URL)
`git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
5. Push to GitHub (main branch)
`git push -u origin main`


In order to add some more files to the last commit:

1. To add any pending files
`git add .`

2. To amend the changes to last commit:
`git commit --amend`
